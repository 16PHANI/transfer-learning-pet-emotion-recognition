🐶🐱 Transfer Learning Based Pet Emotion Recognition

A web-based system that detects cat and dog emotions (Happy, Sad, Angry, Scared, Relaxed, Surprised) using Transfer Learning Models and provides automatic pet care tips based on the detected emotion.

🌟 Project Overview

This project uses deep learning transfer learning model ResNet50 to analyze pet images and classify their emotional state.
The predictions are integrated into a complete web application built using:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python (Flask / Django)

Model: Transfer Learning (ResNet50 / etc.)

Dataset: Cats & Dogs Emotional Dataset (linked via Google Drive)

Model File: model.h5 (linked via Google Drive)
The system also includes multiple pages such as Home, About, Daily Routine, Pet Care Tips, Prediction, and Contact.
